Server in Sharp.

Currently sort of works as a message service, if needed. 

Usage:
EchoSrv <server-ip> connects in client-mode.
EchoSrv starts server.
After that, enter something to start, after which you'll be ready to receive messages.
After sending a message you receive previously unseen updates from everyone.
/q quits client, CTRL-c quits server.
Enter should just get new updates without adding to message stack.
